Abandoned Object Dataset

ABandoned Objects DAtaset (ABODA) is a new public dataset for abandoned object detection. ABODA comprises 10 sequences labeled with various real-application scenarios that are challenging for abandoned-object detection. The situations include crowded scenes, marked changes in lighting condition, night-time detection, as well as indoor and outdoor environments.
